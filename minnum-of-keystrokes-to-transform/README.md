# Compute a minimum number of keystrokes required to transform a word.

Given an "original word" and a "new word" create a method that approximates the minimum number of keystrokes required to transform the "original word" into the "new word." Moving the mouse and using the left mouse button do not count as keystrokes.

Here is an example:
Original Word: "clarity"
New Word: "singularity"

The minimum number of keystrokes to change "clarity" to "singularity" is six (one to delete the "c" and five to type "singu").

This problem can be computationally very difficult to brute force for longer strings so it is ok if your algorithm doesn't 100% guarantee the minimum number of keystrokes. For any trade-offs you make you should articulate in your comments why you are making them and how this impacts the time complexity and the likelihood your code returns the correct answer.

All of your coding should be done in this editor. However you may (and we strongly encourage) that you test your code in your own compiler or interpreter so that you feel confident the code you are submitting is bug free. Lastly since this is a fairly challenging problem we strongly encourage that you type your thoughts as comments as you develop your solution.
